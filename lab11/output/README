LAB11 Readme

Our script will create .out files for all of our "test" cases to be translated

./assembly_daddy.sh

An ./output/ directory will be created, and named .out files will be populated with the C code, followed by its Assembly code, and finalized with a discussion area.

Output files can be cleaned with:

./assembly_daddy.sh -c   or  -clean

.out files and this Readme can be merged into a single file with:

./assembly_daddy.sh -m  or -merge
