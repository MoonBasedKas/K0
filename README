# K0 
K0 is a toy Kotlin compiler developed by Lily Houghteling, Kassidy Maberry, and Erik Noll.

The compiler is meant to cover a small subset of Kotlin where a intro to programming class may use it. Types must be 
explicitly declared, classes have been removed, and the standard library has been reduced. This compiler works on 
x86_64 machines and on most linux operating systems, so long as the user has flex and bison installed. This compiler 
is limited to compiling only one file.

Compiling the Compiler will only require the make command in the directory with the makefile.

Commands:
-tree: Prints out the syntax tree of the program.
-symtab: Prints out the symbol tables of a given program.
-ic: Prints out the generated intermediate code for this compiler.
-s: Prints out the x86_64 assembly in AT&T syntax.
-o: Generates an object file.
