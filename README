Lab8 : Lily, Kassidy, Erik

Lily = 2
Kassidy = 2

We have a python script to run our test cases.
Erik: I would like to point out we also just handle multiple files (99% sure)


Todo (For us):

lab8:
test cases (Done)

HW5:
Seg faults -> line 4 in test3.kt (old)
redeclaration error handling (finished)
Add bools to treenodes
Expand compatible() in typeHelpers.c
- We need to handle const/mutable (one of the bools)

Maybe:

Lily: Separate the params construction -> synthesize paramList?

Erik: We need a refactor. Tree.c currently handles tree stuff and some symTab stuff
